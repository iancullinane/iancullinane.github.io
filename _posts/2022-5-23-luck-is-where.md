*Part of a series on an opportunity I did not achieve. Where I went wrong, critiques on organizations, distributed systems, and code of all sorts.*

I know quite a lot about distributed systems. I have been working with them since the first day of my second internship. Despite that I recently did not get hired for an opportunity working with distributed systems. To boot, the stated reason was they wanted someone who had deeper knowledge on distributed systems. This was, to say the least, disappointing. In further posts I plan to use this failure as a backdrop for a series of posts. The intent of which is to reinforce my own knowledge, provide a host of links to prove my knowledge, and to expand my knowledge through focused posts on topics I enjoy. 

## The "game" of Distributed Systems

This series will focus deeply on gaming, as it is my favoured domain. My favorite "game" is [The Prisoners Dilemma](http://www.iancullinane.com/2022-05-16-Prisoner/) which we will get into further on (when the code is better).

Framing distributed systems as a game is simple. The basic analogy of distributed computing is [The General's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem). Which provides many hooks to game off of, in later posts. Through the lens of the game we will touch on the problems of distributed computing, as well as patterns in dealing with them. In addition, we will be exploring [other games](https://github.com/iancullinane/prisoner-rust) and using those in a distributed architecture to influence the outcomes of The Generals.

## Two Generals (or The Byzantine Generals)

> Two generals must communicate in order to coordinate and attack. There between them lies enemy territory. You cannot assume any single given message as reliable. How can the two generals effectively message each other and coordinate the attack.

This is the general problem statement we are dealing with. I won't expound further [as many have already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem). There are tons of interesting articles but we will be engaging in practical applications. 

My next post will be more in-depth on the Rust programming language, specifically an implementation of The Prisoner's Dilemma. This code is in dev so look at my GitHub to see progress. 

Cheers,
