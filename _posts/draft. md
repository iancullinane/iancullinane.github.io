Published a new container for turning video files into gifs. [eignhpants/gif-factory](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eignhpants/gif-factory) will take the local mounted folder (or any I guess) and turn the contents `.mov` files into `.gif` files. At time of publish it is very dumb and only does `mov` to `gif` because I use it to turn my screen captures into gifs for documentation.

However I will probably add more features since it was pretty simple to implement.

Cheers,
