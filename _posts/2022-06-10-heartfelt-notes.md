It's important to practice self-care. Leave yourself heartfelt notes. I try to do this in code all the time. Usually because present me knows that future me will have forgotten what past me knows so past me leaves a note for future me which solves my problem in the present.

Like this:

```go
	// log.Println(utils.PrettyPrint(reqView.Blocks))
	// ITS DOUBLE IDS ASSHOLE
	_, err := app.ChatClientLib.PublishView(callback.User.ID, reqView, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
```

See? I solved the problem *and* gave my day a little boost.
