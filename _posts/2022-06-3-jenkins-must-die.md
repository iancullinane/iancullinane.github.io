## Jenkins Eternal

Time is a flat circle. 

Years ago we built a [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). And things were good (lol no). A skilled engineer took it to MGP, and there it stayed. Yet I vowed, even then, that it should be destroyed.

I tried drone. I was rejected. I told the build engineer how to kill it. Never prioritized. The engineer became sisyphus and Jenkins his rock. Times were hard.

Undeterred I volunteered four weeks on loan to a team. I Dojo'd Jenkins. We made it a phoenix. We blessed it with containers. Developer velocity skyrocketed. Years long ideas grew fruit. Things were good (fr).

The work was done. Jenkins was dead. I never have to touch it again. 

Now the opportunity has arisen again. The build team needs a leader.

Time is a flat circle.
